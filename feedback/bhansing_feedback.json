{"student_id":"bhansing","status":"Pass AI Feedback","feedback":" Great job on your implementation! Itâ€™s clear and correctly counts the basic operations, demonstrating linear time complexity. To enhance readability, consider adding more comments explaining the logic within the loops. Additionally, you might explore handling edge cases, like empty lists or arrays. This will make your code more robust. Keep up the good work!"}
