{"student_id":"bhansing","status":"Pass AI Feedback","feedback":" Great job! Your implementation of the `reversed` methods for both arrays and lists is working correctly, as evidenced by the successful unit tests. To enhance readability and future maintainability, consider encapsulating the basic operation counting in a separate method, allowing you to easily reuse it. Additionally, you might want to remove any `System.out.println` statements or replace them with logging mechanisms for production code. Keep up the good work in understanding time complexity and efficient coding practices!"}
