{"student_id":"simkah","status":"Pass AI Feedback","feedback":" Excellent job on your implementation! Your `reversed` method for arrays is clear and efficient. However, the `reversed` method for lists currently attempts to call a non-existent method (`list.reversed()`). Consider how you could achieve reversing a list without mutating the original. Also, while your variable names are mostly clear, you could enhance readability by giving more descriptive names, especially for the counting variable in your array reversal. Keep up the good work!"}
