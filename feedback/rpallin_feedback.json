{"student_id":"rpallin","status":"Pass AI Feedback","feedback":" Excellent implementation! All unit tests passed successfully. You could improve efficiency by modifying the loop structure to iterate only until the midpoint of the array or list. Additionally, consider maintaining a counter for operations in a more informative way (e.g., returning it alongside the reversed collection instead of printing). This would enhance the reusability of your method in different contexts. Keep up the great work!"}
