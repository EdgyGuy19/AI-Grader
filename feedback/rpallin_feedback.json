{"student_id":"rpallin","status":"Pass AI Feedback","feedback":" Great job on implementing both the array and list reversing methods! Your approach is clear and functional. To enhance efficiency, consider avoiding the double loop when copying values; this could reduce the number of operations you are counting. Additionally, you might want to handle edge cases more gracefully, e.g., eliminating the need for the check `if (array.length == 0)` in both methods since they can proceed naturally with the current implementation. Keep up the good work and focus on refining your logic!"}
